# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	** git init **
	A .git file is made in the repository. For git to track changes in the repository to
	the files.
	Additionally, to see any changes i use ** git status **


# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area seems to be the place where you add file(** git add ** ) to allow any
	tracking a file or multiple files. This will help us achieve one commit per logical
	test.

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	** git diff -- staged **
	Compares the working directory and the staging area. Thus, if i make changes to the
	a file in the working directory, i can confirm if those are the right changes with the
	above command. Also, if the satisfy one commit per logical change to proceed.
