Ingredients:
 - 1 cup of whole wheat flour
 - 1 pinch of salt
 - 1 tablespoon of olive oil
 - 1/4 cup of water

Directions:
1. Sift together flour and salt in a bowl. Stir in olive oil and water, and then knead
until firm and elastic. Divide into four balls, and roll as flat as possible with a
rolling pin.
2. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chapati on both sides until
golden brown, about 1 minute per side. If desired, sprinkle with additional
olive oil before serving.
