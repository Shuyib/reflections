When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
      When i'm working on project/projects so that i can keep other versions in case of anything.
      If i'm working on something and in a few days i'll be travelling and i want to continue working on the file elsewhere
      and i'm using another computer.
     ** git remote **
     Used when you want to push a local file to github remote server.
     
     Process: Make sure you are where you initialized git version control system that is, the file.
     Run git remote add origin URL github provides once you've named and created the repository
     (labelled for command line).
     Verify if URL has been accepted in your machine (output: fetch and push links the same).
     Use git push origin master to upload to your created repository on github.
