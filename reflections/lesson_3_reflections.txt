# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
      When i'm working on project/projects so that i can keep other versions in case of
      anything.
      If i'm working on something and in a few days i'll be travelling and i want to
      continue working on the file elsewhere
      and i'm using another computer.
     ** git remote **
     Used when you want to push a local file to github remote server.

     Process: Make sure you are where you initialized git version control system that is,
     the file.
     Run git remote add origin URL github provides once you've named and created the
     repository
     (labelled for command line).
     Verify if URL has been accepted in your machine (output: fetch and push links the
     same).
     Use git push origin master to upload to your created repository on github.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I suppose this alludes to Git pulling all the changes including those you didn't want
	to pull in the first place.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	** git fork ** [use in github only]
	Only applies to github, however, it is the same as the clone.
	side effects include:
	keeps track of forks
	forks link back to the original
	suggesting changes easier

	** git clone ** [github to local]
	Kage Bushin no jutsu [Naruto]
	Make a replica of the original repo.

	** git branch ** [either though local makes it easier to look into]
	applies when you want to make different versions of the master repo
